What are DOM Mutations?

DOM mutations refer to changes that occur in the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page.
The DOM is a representation of the HTML elements on a web page, and it can be manipulated using JavaScript.
DOM mutations occur when the structure or content of the DOM is modified, such as adding, removing, or modifying elements or attributes.

These mutations can be caused by various actions, such as user interactions, JavaScript code execution,
or updates from external sources. For example, when a user clicks a button that triggers a JavaScript
function to add a new element to the page, it causes a DOM mutation. Similarly, if data from a server is received and
used to update the content of a web page, it also results in DOM mutations.

Questions 1:
Event handlers attached to elements are preserved; things that persist after
refreshing the page

Question 4:
Data Binding, many frameworks have data binding mechanisms that automate the
synchronization of data between the model (application state) and the view.

A list made by a user gets updated. When it's updated something else needs to changes on 
the page. 
One way data binding means data can only flow down, two way data binding means data
can only flow down.
Flowing data up or down the component tree? Components build within components.

Deterministic - always determinable, when we run the thing we always expect the same result.
