What are DOM Mutations?

DOM mutations refer to changes that occur in the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page.
The DOM is a representation of the HTML elements on a web page, and it can be manipulated using JavaScript.
DOM mutations occur when the structure or content of the DOM is modified, such as adding, removing, or modifying elements or attributes.

These mutations can be caused by various actions, such as user interactions, JavaScript code execution,
or updates from external sources. For example, when a user clicks a button that triggers a JavaScript
function to add a new element to the page, it causes a DOM mutation. Similarly, if data from a server is received and
used to update the content of a web page, it also results in DOM mutations.
